                    <p class="post-description" style="font-weight: bold;">
                        (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club House, in Pasadena, California, on January 18, 1900)

                        SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: "Some persons desire to ask questions about Hindu Philosophy
                        before the lecture and to question in general about India after the lecture; but the chief
                        difficulty is I do not know what I am to lecture on. I would be very glad to lecture on any
                        subject, either on Hindu Philosophy or on anything concerning the race, its history, or its
                        literature. If you, ladies and gentlemen, will suggest anything, I would be very glad."
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-description">
                        QUESTIONER: "I would like to ask, Swami, what special principle in Hindu Philosophy you
would have us Americans, who are a very practical people, adopt, and what that would do
for us beyond what Christianity can do."
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-description">
                        SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: "That is very difficult for me to decide; it rests upon you. If you
find anything which you think you ought to adopt, and which will be helpful, you should
take that. You see I am not a missionary, and I am not going about converting people to
my idea. My principle is that all such ideas are good and great, so that some of your ideas
may suit some people in India, and some of our ideas may suit some people here; so ideas
must be cast abroad, all over the world."
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-description">
                        QUESTIONER: "We would like to know the result of your philosophy; has your philosophy
and religion lifted your women above our women?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-description">
                        SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: "You see, that is a very invidious question: I like our women and
your women too."

                    </p>
                    <p class="post-description">
                        QUESTIONER: "Well, will you tell us about your women, their customs and education, and
the position they hold in the family?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-description">
                        SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: "Oh, yes, those things I would be very glad to tell you. So you
want to know about Indian women tonight, and not philosophy and other things?"
